Forests are critical for maintaining ecological balance. They act as carbon sinks, regulate the water cycle, and support a diverse range of species. Deforestation, which is the large-scale removal of trees, has far-reaching environmental and social impacts.

For example, deforestation causes soil erosion, reducing land fertility. It leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions that contribute to global warming. The removal of trees disrupts the natural water cycle, often resulting in reduced rainfall and water scarcity. In addition, deforestation results in the loss of biodiversity and can displace indigenous communities.

Sustainable forest management is essential to mitigate these impacts and preserve the environment.
