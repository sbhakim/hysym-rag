Forests are essential for biodiversity, carbon storage, and water regulation.

If deforestation occurs, then there is a loss of biodiversity.
Whenever deforestation continues unchecked, it leads to an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels.
If trees are removed for agriculture, then the soil becomes more prone to erosion.

In many tropical regions, deforestation is often driven by the demand for timber, farmland, or housing.
