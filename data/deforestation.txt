Forests are essential for biodiversity, carbon storage, and water regulation.

If deforestation occurs, then there is a loss of biodiversity.
If deforestation continues unchecked, then carbon dioxide (CO2) levels increase.
If trees are removed for agriculture, then the soil becomes more prone to erosion.
If deforestation is driven by the demand for timber, farmland, or housing in tropical regions, then environmental degradation intensifies.
If forest cover is reduced, then water regulation and local climate stability are compromised.
If unsustainable logging practices occur, then habitat fragmentation increases, leading to a decline in native species.
If deforestation accelerates, then the loss of ecosystem services disrupts regional economies.
